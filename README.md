This is a demonostration on how to crack a Wi-Fi netowrk's password. The tools used to steal the password is a demonstration of reconassiance on a potential victim to gather information and discovery of how to get into the internal network zone. 

It aims to demonostrate on how to get the password and crack it. It is meant to show people how easy it is and that they should have strong passwords, even on their Router. If a threat actor steals the password and can get in the internal network, they can do further enumeration to gather victim information via network traffic, steal private information, get into other devices connected, and even implement malware. It is a gateway for an attacker to get into the network and do all sorts of cybercrime.

People tend to not think of having strong network passwords because they think an attacker won't target them because they have nothing to offer. Also, they think an attacker has to be close to the area to crack their password. Also, people do not like entering long, complicated passwords everytime to authetnicate a new device to their network.

In this project, you can use a Wi-Fi adapter to scan nearby networks, unathenticate devices to it, capture the 4-way handshake that contains the unique signature of a device, and use a wordlist for a dictionary attack to crack the password.
